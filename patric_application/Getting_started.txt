A little guide on how to get started with using DendroNet in the context of antibiotic resistance identification



Now, some files will need to be downloaded from the following link: https://docs.patricbrc.org/user_guides/ftp.html
The first file, called genome_lineage, will be used to create a phylogenetic tree using the taxonomical classification
of the bacterial species of interest. Call this file genome_lineage.csv and place it in the data_files directory.
The second, called PATRIC_genome_AMR.txt, will be used to gather the antibiotic resistance data that will be needed
for training the model. This file must be called amr_phenotypes.csv and placed in the data_files directory
An alternative and more flexible method to using this file will presented later.

Downloading these files can be done from the command line using wget or curl.
